Image::PNG::FileConvert - convert a file to or from a PNG image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of [% module %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can convert any arbitrary data file, either binary or
text, into a PNG image. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless
image format. (See L<Image::PNG::Libpng/SEE ALSO> for details about
the PNG format.)  Lossless means that there is no loss of data;
whatever data is put into the original image can always be recovered
exactly. This module takes advantage of that to use PNG image format
to store arbitrary data under the guise of a PNG image.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 file2png

    file2png ('myfile.txt', 'myfile.png');

Convert C<myfile.txt> into a PNG graphic. The function uses the data
from myfile.txt to write a greyscale (black and white) image. The
bytes of the file correspond to the pixels of the image.

When this PNG is unwrapped using L</png2file>, it will be called
C<myfile.txt> again. If you want to specify a different name,

    file2png ('myfile.txt', 'myfile.png',
              { name => 'not-the-same-name.txt' });

and the file will be unwrapped into C<not-the-same-name.txt>.

If you want your PNG to have a different width than the default, there
is another option, C<row_length>, specified in the same way:

    file2png ('myfile.txt', 'myfile.png', { row_length => 0x100 });

The number you specify for C<row_length> will be the width of the
image in pixels. If this is not specified, the row length is given by
C<default_row_length> in the module, which is [% default_row_length %]
as of version [% info.version %] of this module.

=head2 png2file

    png2file ('myfile.png');

Convert C<myfile.png> into a data file. C<myfile.png> must be a PNG
created using L</file2png>. The file is stored in whatever the name of
the file given to L</file2png> was.

This only converts PNG files output by L</file2png>, not general PNG
files. L</file2png> uses the text segment of the PNG image to store
the name and number of bytes of the original data, and without that
the data cannot be recovered.

An option "name" overrides the file name used in the input:

    file2png ('file.png', name => 'another-name.txt');

=head1 BUGS

=over

=item Holds file in memory

Both the routines here hold the entire file in memory, limiting the
data size which can be converted to or from a PNG.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item Acme::Steganography::Image::Png

L<Acme::Steganography::Image::Png> hides data in a PNG image.

=item Image::PNG::Write::BW

L<Image::PNG::Write::BW> creates minimal black and white PNG files
from user data.

=back

=head1 SCRIPTS

The distribution also includes two utility scripts, file2png and
png2file, which convert a file to a PNG image and back again.
